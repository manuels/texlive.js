README for version 3.14159-1.40.2
=================================

This directory contains the version 1.40.2 of pdfTeX, an extended version
of eTeX that can create PDF directly from TeX source files and enhance the
result of TeX typesetting with the help of PDF. When PDF output is not
selected, pdfTeX produces normal DVI output, otherwise it produces PDF
output that looks identical to the DVI output. An important aspect of this
project is to investigate alternative justification algorithms, optionally
making use of multiple master fonts.

pdfTeX is based on the original eTeX sources and Web2c, and has been
successfully compiled on Unix, Win32 and DOS systems. It is still under
development and features may change; it produces reasonable PDF code.

See the file NEWS for changes to the program.

Documentation about pdfTeX can be found at http://www.pdftex.org

There is also a mailing list on pdfTeX; go to
http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/pdftex for more information about it. Its
searchable archive can be found at http://tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/
Please read http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html before
asking any questions on the pdfTeX mailing list.
