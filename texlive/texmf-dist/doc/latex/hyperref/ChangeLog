    * 6.83m
    * Option `pdflang': Default is `\relax' that suppresses
      the entry in the PDF catalogue. An empty value (undetermined
      language) is written to the PDF catalogue.
    * Option `pdflang': Checks for well-formedness added
      (if \pdfmatch is available).
    * Option `hyperindex': The latest encapsulating command is repeated
      for the close range entries, if it is not already given. That improves
      compatibility to `xindy'. (Formatting commands remain unsupported.)

2012-10-31  6.83l  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.83l
    * Workaround for bug in `frenchb.ldf' 2010/08/21 v2.5a added that

2012-10-15  6.83k  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.83k
    * If `hyperref' is loaded in the document class and `htlatex' is used,
      then `hyperref' passes options for `tex4ht' found in \@documentclasshook
      to `tex4ht'.
    * \hyper@link@ suppresses links with empty target.

2012-10-13  6.83j  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.83j

2012-10-12  6.83i  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.83i
    * PDF forms: /CO (calculation order) is set for fields with
      calculations. Only document order is supported currently.
    * pdfmark.def: /Fields is set like in the other PDF form drivers.

2012-10-11  6.83h  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.83h
    * If `hyperref' is loaded in the document class, then it misses
      the detection of package `tex4ht' of `htlatex' because it is
      loaded after the documentclass. Therefore another test for
      `\HCode' is added that is defined by `htlatex'.
    * The setting of additional information entries is done globally
      like the other standard options (pdfauthor, pdftitle, ...)
      for the information dictionary. (Bug report:
      http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/75684/16967)

    * 6.82o
    * At the begin and end of an equation an \hbox might be
      present that affects math spacing (for example, if the
      equation starts with an unary minus). By putting \hbox
      in \mathopen/\mathclose, now only a math punctuation at
      the end of the equation will add some space afterwords.
      Environment eqnarray is fixed in a similar way, also
      its anchor position is fixed.

2011-12-06  6.82n  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.82n

      to avoid the error that \pdfstartlink cannot be
      used in vertical mode. (Bug reported by GL.)

2011-11-19  6.82k  Heiko Oberdiek

    * pdfmark.def: better support of hyphenation if breaklinks=false.

2010-03-01  6.80i  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.80i
    * hpdftex.def: form fields array collects field references
      via .aux file to avoid recording field references of field
      inside canceled boxes.
    * README updated.

2010-02-25  6.80h  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.80h
    * Compatibility for KOMA-Script's \footref.

2010-02-24  6.80g  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.80g
    * Option `verbose': anchors and internal links are recorded in
      the .log file for all drivers.

2010-02-21  6.80f  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.80f
    * Unicode support is loaded only if unicode is set to true.
      Previously the option regardless of setting triggered
      the loading of unicode support (or an error, if after
      \begin{document}).

2010-02-08  6.80e  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.80e
    * \ref and \pageref robust again before \begin{document}.
      (Bug report by Gerrit Schmitz.)
    * Project/repository moved to Puszcza
      (https://puszcza.gnu.org.ua/projects/hyperref).

2010-01-25  6.80d  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.80d
    * License update to LPPL 1.3+
    * nameref 2.36, backref 1.34: LPPL 1.3+

2010-01-16  6.80c  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.80c
    * Problem with package `titlesec' fixed (reported by GL in comp.text.tex).
    * backref 1.33:
      * \backrefentrycount added.
      * Internal calculations for \backrefalt and \backrefentrycount
        are disabled, if these features are not used.

2010-01-11  6.80b  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.80b
    * Options `pdfinfo' and `pdftrapped' added.

2010-01-09  Heiko Oberdiek
    * backref 1.32:
      * Brazilian Portuguese added (Rog\'erio Brito).
      * Some language aliases added.

2010-01-08  6.80a  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.80a
    * Missing \expandafter added for fix in 6.79z.
      `\.' now works again for other languages than Spanish
       in bookmarks.

2009-12-28  6.79z  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79z
    * \pdfstringdef/spanish.ldf: \. breaks \pdfstringdef,
      therefore it is restored as dot accent (\es@save@dot).
      \... is not supported. Use \texorpdfstring{\...}{\dots} instead.

2009-12-23  6.79y  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79y
    * Global papersize options (a4paper, ...) ignored.

2009-12-22  6.79x  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79x
    * Checking \@outlinefile before writing (workaround for
      beamer bug in beamerbasecompatibility 1.63).

2009-12-18  6.79w  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79w
    * Again anchor setting in unnumbered sections fixed.
      \@currentHref gets overwritten by float objects right
      after inline section commands like \paragraph, \subparagraph.
      Reported by Lev Bishop.
      Now the reference name (\@currentHref) is passed by value
      (expanded) to the anchor setting code.
    * nameref 2.35: Required date for package `gettitlestring' updated.

2009-12-17  6.79v  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79v
    * Fix for `pdfencoding=auto', the code accidently got
      deleted for the other drivers than XeTeX.
    * `pdfencoding=auto' for XeTeX now adds a method to suppress the
      warning "Failed to convert input string to UTF16...", see README.

2009-12-16  6.79u  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79u
    * Babel patch of 6.77o rewritten that babel can be loaded
      after hyperref.

2009-12-15  6.79t  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79t
    * hxetex: Using encoding `ascii-print' for
      `pdfencoding=auto'.

2009-12-15  6.79s  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79s
    * Removed paper options of 6.79o now generate a warning
      instead of an error.

2009-12-15  6.79r  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79r
    * hxetex: default is now `pdfencoding=auto' because of
      bug of AR7/Linux regarding page labels.

2009-12-15  6.79p  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79p
    * hxetex: PDFDocEncoding is not supported, only
      option `unicode', `pdfencoding=unicode' or `pdfencoding=auto'.
      In the latter case, PDFDocEncoding is only used, if the
      string is an ascii string (7-bit characters).
      No idea, how to get rid of the warning
      "Failed to convert input string to UTF16...".
      The strings are already in UTF16, thus an additional conversion
      have to fail.
    * Missing package dependency added: intcalc (Vladimir Volovich).

2009-12-14  6.79o  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79o
    * Paper options `a4paper', `a5paper' are ignored.
      Setting the page size is done by using \paperwidth
      and \paperheight. Or in case of memoir \stockwidth and
      \stockheight are used. Evaluation time for setting the page size
      is at begin of document or first page (driver dependant).
    * XeTeX has its own driver file `hxetex.def' (based on hdvipdfm.def).
    * hxetex.def uses pdfTeX's \pdfpagewidth and \pagepageheight
      for setting the media size.

2009-12-10  6.79n  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79n
    * Use of package `rerunfilecheck'.
    * backref 1.31: Use of package `rerunfilecheck'.

2009-12-09  6.79m  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79m
    * \clear@document (REVTeX} is not used in favor of \AtVeryEndDocument
      (Arthur Ogawa).
      * backref 1.30: Use of package `atveryend'.

2009-12-08  6.79l  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79l
    * \Hy@SectionAnchor disabled in bookmarks.
    * \clearpage is not added in \AtEndDocument any more by using
      package `atveryend' instead to prevent problems with column
      balancing in revtex (reported by Arthur Ogawa).
    * \@caption uses \NR@gettitle from package `nameref' if available.
    * nameref 2.34:
      * Redefinition of \@caption is restricted to
        the case if hyperref 6.79l or later is not loaded.
      * Use of package `gettitlestring' for postprocessing
        the title strings.

2009-11-27  Heiko Oberdiek
    * nameref 2.33: \phantomsection and \addcontentsline are disabled during
      title string expansion.

2009-11-27  6.79k  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79k
    * Fix of anchor setting: The anchor setting is filtered out
      for title extracting classes and packages (memoir, titleref,
      zref-titleref, nameref 2.32.
    * nameref 2.32: the title string is expanded to filter out
      unwanted stuff (same way as memoir, titleref, zref-titleref).

2009-11-27  6.79j  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79j
    * Fix of anchor setting for section titles in 6.79h is made
      a little more robust.

2009-11-26  6.79i  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79i
    * Support for empty category parameter fixed for \hyperref and \hyperdef.
    * \hyperdef fixed (.aux file entry).

2009-11-25  6.79h  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79h
    * Fix of anchor setting for section titles.
      * chapters, parts (Markus Kohm),
      * unnumbered sections.
      Now the workarounds with \phantomsection like
        \cleardoublepage\phantomsection\printindex
      should not be necessary any longer.
    * nohyperref: star from \ref and \pageref ignored (Henrik Tidefelt).

2009-11-20  6.79g  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79g
    * \pdfstringdef: Support for unicode characters added
      for XeTeX and LuaTeX.

2009-11-15  6.79f  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79f
    * Forms: Bug in \HyField@PDFChoices fixed, wrong order of
      export and display value (Donald P. Story).

2009-11-14  6.79e  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79e
    * Rerun warning added for bookmarks, based on MD5 sum and file size.
      (This feature requires pdfTeX or LuaTeX.)
    * backref 1.29:
      * Rerun warning added, based on MD5 sum and file size.
        (This feature requires pdfTeX or LuaTeX.)

2009-10-31  6.79d  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79d
    * Full support of makeindex's encap feature (e.g. \index{alpha|textbf}).
      \hyperpage and the formatting command are cascaded via
      \hyperindexformat. Internally \index{alpha|textbf} is transferred
      to \index{alpha|hyperindexformat{\textbf}}. \hyperindexformat calls
      the formatting command in its first argument with the page range
      as argument that is put into \hyperpage. The formatting command
      may call \hyperpage itself, it will be disabled automatically
      to prevent nested \hyperpage commands.

2009-10-28  6.79c  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79c
    * Fix for a wrong byte "0xA0", accidently introduced in 6.79b.
    * Adding bookmark sequence numbers in comments to the bookmark
      auxiliary file (Vladimier Volovich).
    * Manual fix: pdfpicktrackbypdfsize -> pdfpicktraybypdfsize
      (Gregor Zimmermann).

2009-10-19  6.79b  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79b
    * Respect \stockwidth and \stockheight for drivers `dvips'
      and `dvipdfm'.

2009-10-09  6.79a  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.79a
    * Field option `radiosymbol' added.
    * Both `checkboxsymbol' and `radiosymbol' support \ding
      (see package `pifont' from bundle `psnfss2e').

2009-10-02  6.78w  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78w
    * Recognize `amsmidx' as multiple index package (David M. Jones).
    * Manual fixes (Herbert Voss).

2009-09-22  6.78v  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78v
    * PDF objects needed for formulars are only allocated if
      environment `Form' is used (hpdftex, hdvipdfm).

2009-09-10  6.78u  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78u
    * Support for open outlines is turned on for XeTeX >= 0.9995.
      Thus option `dvipdfmx-outline-open' is not necessary in this case.
      I don't know about older versions of XeTeX.
    * Additions to the manual (aliascnt, bookmarks).

2009-08-04  6.78t  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78t
    * Fix: Option `bookmarksdepth' with name value now also works
      as package option.

2009-05-23  6.78s  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78s
    * Fix: "\let\textlatin\@firstofone from \addcontentsline.

2009-05-01  6.78r  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78r
    * \pdfstringdef:
      * Typo in definition of \new@ifnextchar fixed (Ulrike Fischer),
      * and \kernel@ifnextchar disabled (Dan Luecking).
    * dvipdfm(x)/xetex: This driver family does not support nested
      annotations. Therefore annotations inside annotations are
      disabled automatically.

2009-04-04  6.78q  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78q
    * Better error message for \MakeUppercase and \MakeLowercase
      in \pdfstringdef (bookmarks).
    * Expandable simulation of \ignorespaces in bookmarks.
    * The values of boolean options are now expanded (\Hy@boolkey).
    * Warnings added for links with empty destination name.

2009-02-22  6.78p  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78p
    * hpdftex.def: Problem fixed, if a link is broken across the
      first and the next page.

2009-02-02  6.78o  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78o
    * Workaround for package `linguex' added (it redefines the
      accent macros \b, \c, \d).

2008-12-26  6.78n  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78n
    * Support of active `&' and \& in \href (\hyper@normalise).

2008-11-18  6.78m  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78m
    * The fix for fancyvrb in hyperef 1998-03-21 is not compatible with
      and necessary for fancyvrb 1998-05-20 or later. Therefore the
      fix is disabled for these versions.
    * Option `ocgcolorlinks': Fix for driver `dvipdfm'.
    * Improved anchor setting for package `amsthm' (Daniel M\"ullner).

2008-09-29  6.78l  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78l
    * Bookmarks: `--' and `---' are automatically replaced by \textendash
      and \textemdash in bookmark strings. However older AR versions
      (until AR5/Linux) might miss these glyphs.
    * Encoding name in warnings `Token not allowed' fixed.

2008-09-27  6.78k  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78k
    * Fix for `slovak' and other babel languages that make `^' and other
      characters active. This disturbs loading of package `color' and
      perhaps `nameref' that are loaded later at begin document.

2008-09-13  6.78j  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78j
    * Forms/hpdftex.def: Missing /Fields entry is set in the same way
      as it is done by the other drivers.

2008-09-12  6.78i  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78i
    * \pdfstringdef: accent support of encoding PU reimplemented
      in a cleaner way.

2008-09-11  6.78h  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78h
    * \pdfstringdef:
      * Warning in case of unsupported composite characters fixed.
      * Unknown composite characters use Unicode combining accents
        if possible.
      * Supported range in PU encoding improved, especially
        extended latin sets, cyrillic, and standard LICRs.
      * Various fixes in encodig files (pd1enc.def, puenc.def).

2008-08-20  6.78g  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78g
    * Patch for \pdfstringdef of Manuel P\'egouri\'e-Gonnard
      for package `xargs'.
    * Option pdfversion accepts versions until 1.9.

2008-08-14  6.78f  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78f
    * \nohyperref added to support custom entries in style files
      of MakeIndex (delim_r, suffix_*), see README.

2008-07-23  6.78e  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78e
    * Driver hdvipdfm.def: Missing code for option `setpagesize' added.
    * README: Entry for package geometry/dvipdfm added.

2008-07-17  6.78d  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78d
    * Bug fix in disabled onclick field for PDF/A (Radhakrishnan CV).

2008-07-16  6.78c  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78c
    * \HyperDestNameFilter added.
      (Feature request by Matthias Franz.)
    * htex4ht.cfg: \MP corrected.

2008-07-15  6.78b  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78b
    * Option `colorlinks': border properties are not cleared immediately,
      but at evaluation time in \AtBeginDocument. This allows a setting
      of colorlinks in hyperref.cfg and using colorlinks=false in the
      document without getting lost of the link borders.
      (Problem reported by Axel Berger.)

2008-07-12  6.78a  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.78a
    * Driver options: Algorithm for finding the driver is changed:
      * Code for detecting the driver is more robust
        (not confused by \newcount\pdfoutput, solves a problem with beamer).
      * Driver hpdftex.def is used/forced if and only if pdfTeX is running
        in PDF mode. Thus hyperref now behaves like the other packages that
        do not change PDF mode.
      * Also some other driver options are checked.
    * Driver hpdftex.def:
      * Setting of \pdfcompresslevel is removed.
      * \PassOptionsToPackage{pdftex}{color} is removed.
    * Option dvipdf with driver hdvipdf.def is removed.
      (Nobody missed it since 2006-08-01 v6.75a.)

2008-07-05  6.77v  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77v
    * Fix: Use normal meaning of babel's shorthand characters in
      markup text of links. (Bug found by Ign\'acio Fernandez Galv\'an.)

2008-04-24  6.77u  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77u
    * Fix in action code for PDF/A, introduced in 6.77p (e.g. \PushButton).

2008-04-22  6.77t  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77t
    * Fix: \nameref in bookmarks.
    * Fix for dvipsone: unknown `?pdfmark'.

2008-04-20  6.77s  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77s
    * Additions to PU encoding: \textzerosuperior, ..., \textninesuperior,
      \textzeroinferior, ..., \textnineinferior

2008-04-19  6.77r  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77r
    * Option pdfa: pdf version is set to 1.4.
    * Experimental option `ocgcolorlinks': Same as `colorlinks',
      but prints without color. Optional Color Groups of PDF 1.5
      are used. Main disadvantage: the links cannot be wrapped
      across lines, because they are put in an \hbox. Currently
      only drivers `pdftex' and `dvipdfm' are supported.

2008-04-17  6.77q  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77q
    * Fix for small problem with XeLaTeX (\string^^f4).

2008-04-16  6.77p  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77p
    * Patch for missing anchor settings with amsmath (multline) by
      Ross Moore.
    * New option `pdfa' to improve compatibility with PDF/A,
      see README.

2008-04-15  6.77o  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77o
    * Babel 2008/03/16 v3.8j disables shorthands for bookmarks.
      This reduces the probability of warnings, but at the cost
      of ugly bookmarks. Therefore hyperref tries to undo this.
      See LaTeX bug-report `babel/4017'.
    * Fix for bulgarian.ldf's \@Alph and \@alph for \hyper@makecurrent.
    * Patch for missing anchor settings with amsmath (multline) by
      Ross Moore.

2008-04-13  6.77n  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77n
    * New option `linktoc' added, see README.

      sequences starting with ^^f4).
    * Fix: unicode disabled for pdfmoddate and pdfcreationdate.
    * Fix for footnote support of fancyvrb (Manuel P\'egouri\'e-Gonnard).
    * Fix for anchor name settings inside numbered lists.
    * Russian update with comments (Olga Lapko).

2008-04-05  6.77l  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77l
    * \CheckSum fixed.
    * hyperref-tds.zip renamed to hyperref.tds.zip.

2008-04-02  6.77k  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77k
    * Macro \SliTeX supported by \pdfstringdef.

2008-02-06  6.77j  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77j
    * Bug (typo) in \PushButton fixed (inserted in 6.77a).
    * Bug (typo) in hdviwindo.def fixed (Fran\c cois Charette).

2008-01-09  6.77i  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77i
    * Russian names for \autoref added (Olga Lapko).

2007-12-16  6.77h  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77h
    * \Hy@pstringdef(baseurl, ...) with \edef~{\string~}

2007-11-20  6.77g  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77g
    * Forms: /MK suppressed if empty.

2007-11-17  6.77f  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77f
    * Bug fix for dviwindo: misspelled \Hy@DisableOption (Philip Ratcliffe).

2007-11-12  6.77e  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77e
    * LuaTeX: Package `pdftexcmds' for \pdfescapestring.
    * Default producer setting recognices XeTeX and LuaTeX.

2007-11-08  6.77d  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77d
    * If `pdfstartpage' or `pdfstartview' is empty,
      the catalog key /OpenAction is omitted.

2007-11-05  6.77c  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77c
    * Fix for memoir: \stockwith -> \stockwidth.

2007-10-30  6.77b  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77b
    * Option `pdfnewwindow': setting to `true' or `false' sets the
      entry /NewWindow in the action object. The entry is absent,
      if the `pdfnewwindow' is not used or its value is empty
      (then the user preference is used).

2007-10-29  6.77a  Heiko Oberdiek
    * 6.77a
    * New PDF form field options for flag setting, see README.
    * The ugly hooking in \@begindvi is removed in favor of
      using package `atbegshi'.
      * \@hyperfixhead don't exist anymore.
      * Patch of fancybox is obsolete.
      * \AtBeginDvi replaced by \AtBeginShipoutFirst
    * Obscure \HYPERPAGEANCHOR is removed.
    * If \paperwidth and \paperheight contain invalid values, then
      \special{papersize=...} is suppressed and a warning is given.
    * revtex4/driver pdftex: pdfpagelabels uses \clear@document as hook
        instead of LaTeX's \AtEndDocument. This avoids \clearpage that

      The default height for multiline entries was calculated before
      the option was evaluated. The default height of multiline entries
      can be configured by \DefaultHeightofTextMultiline.
      Default is 4\baselineskip.
    * \nolinkurl supports escaped characters the same way as \url
      (Joseph Wright).
    * backref 1.28: Avoids duplicate \newwrite calls.

    * New field option `rotation' added.
    * Field options bordercolor and backgroundcolor:

    * Fix for drivers dvipdfm/pdfmark: launch annotation now uses
      `runbordercolor' instead of `filebordercolor'.

      especially generated by forms, if the postscript
      application does not define pdfmark, e.g. because the
      output is not pdf (gs >= 8.0).
    * New version numbering scheme of pdfTeX >= 1.30.
    * Fix for \hyper@normalise, if & is used inside \href
      in tabular environments.
    * Fix: Setting pdfproducer in \usepackage's option part
      did'nt have an effect, because it was overwritten by
      the default setting.
    * Fix: pageanchor=false disabled \@hyperfixhead and thus
      many other features unrelated to pageanchor itself.

    * 6.71g
    * Contributions by Ross Moore <ross@ics.mq.edu.au> and
      Daniel Steffen:
      a. patch to  htexture.def  that adjusts the PDF@SetupDoc

         compatibility with the  ldump.sty  package.
    * Bug fix in multind support (forgotten backslash).
    * Fix for driver pdftex: \pdfpagewidth and \pdfpageheight
      are not set, if \paperwidth or \paperheight are zero,

      to differentiate between a unused or empty option.

      incompatibility with ps2pdf
