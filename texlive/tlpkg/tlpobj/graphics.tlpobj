shortdesc Standard LaTeX graphics.

longdesc The package was designed to accommodate all needs for inclusion
longdesc of graphics in LaTeX documents, replacing many earlier packages
longdesc used in LaTeX 2.09. The package aims to give a consistent
longdesc interface to including the file types that are understood in
longdesc your output, by use of 'printer drivers' (now known, simply, as
longdesc 'drivers'). The distribtion of the package contains several
longdesc drivers, but others (for example, pdfTeX) are distributed
longdesc separately. The package also offers several means of
longdesc manipulating graphics in the course of inserting them into a
longdesc document (for example, rotation and scaling). For extended
longdesc documentation see epslatex. The package is part of the graphics
longdesc bundle, which is one of the collections in the LaTeX 'required'
longdesc set of packages.
