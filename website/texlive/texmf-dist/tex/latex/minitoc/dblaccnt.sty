% This is the file dblaccnt.tex which implements support for multiple
% accents.
%
%
% The code below handles only the case of
%
% \acc1 \acc2 ... glyph
%
% with or without nesting braces.
%
% \acc1 {\acc2 a}
%
% etc. will be handled correctly by removing the brace group during
% the scanning process.  This means in particular that conceptually
% any accent command can only handle single token arguments!
%
% It should also work for combinations generated from inputenc, i.e.,
% are presented as 8bit tokens or, after passing through something like
% an .aux file, as \IeC{\acc1} \IeC{\acc2} ...
%
% If you use OT1 encoding you have to explicitly reload it (with
% \usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}).

% We must redefine two internal LaTeX commands to provide hooks for
% assembling accents.

% Here we test whether #1 (the command to be executed) is \chardef or
% #3 (the encoding) is `?'.  If both are false, \assemble@accent@cmds
% will be used.
%
% The first case catches \DeclareTextSymbol, the second catches
% \ProvideTextCommandDefault.  Both checks are ugly hacks which hopefully
% disappear in the near future.

% We start \assemble@tokens with the number of hits so far (\@empty),
% zero the actual code for the current, e.g., \OT1\^ in the above

% encoding), and as a third argument we will pick up the next token

}


% The next commands should be considered only as a proof of concept
% -- they can most certainly be streamlined.  Here is roughly what
% they do:
%
% \assemble@tokens: If the picked up token is \IeC then get rid of it
%   and parse the next token (or group) which is expected to be the
%   argument of \IeC.  This is done by restarting the whole process.
%   Otherwise we have to figure out if the current token (#3) is an
%   8-bit from inputenc, i.e., expanding to \IeC{...}.  This is
%   handled by calling \assemble@tokensz passing an expansion of #3
%   as well as #3 (or more exactly, its first token since the braces
%   get removed in this process) itself.
%
% \assemble@tokensz: Test if the expansion start with \IeC in which
%   case it is assumed that it comes from an inputenc 8bit; the next
%   token will be considered as its argument and used for further
%   processing in \assemble@tokensx.  Otherwise the unexpanded #3
%   from above is used.
%
% \assemble@tokensx: If this cmd is called its third argument should
%   contain a normalized token from the input stream, i.e.
%
%     {..}      -> ..
%     \IeC{..}  -> ..
%     ^^xx (expanding to) \IeC{..}  -> ..
%
% Now all :-) that remains is testing whether the expansion of this
% token starts with \assemble@accent@cmds, since in this case we have
% found another accent cmd.
%
% #1 is the number of hits, #2 is the real definition in that
% encoding, and #3 is the next token (or group).
%
% The macros \assemble@tokens@ and \assemble@tokens@@ are
% intermediate steps to test whether #3 is empty; if yes, we simply
% expand #2.
%
\def\assemble@tokens@#1#2#3{
  \assemble@tokens@@{#1}{#2}{#3}{#3\@empty}
}

\def\assemble@tokens@@#1#2#3#4{

  {\assemble@tokensx{#3}{#4}#5}
}

% \assemble@tokensx: This passes an expanded and unexpanded version
%   of #3 to \ifassemble@tokens to do the actual processing.
%
% \ifassemble@tokens: If we have found another accent command then
%   keep its name and record that we had another hit and restart the
%   scanning via \assemble@tokens, i.e., we append an `x' to the
%   ``hit'' argument that we carry around for no good reason, and we
%   append the official name of the accent command (which was picked
%   up as part of the expansion of the input token) to the argument,
%   storing the list of accents found so far.  Note that we do use
%   the official name, e.g. `\"', not `\OT1\"' -- the latter is only
%   used for the very first accent!
%
% If it turns out that we don't have an accent command here it is
% time to stop the scanning and do some processing.  Now finally the
% ``hit'' argument and the list of collected accents comes into play:
% We construct a command which name consists of the string
% ``handle@accent'', followed by a number of `x's each for each hit
% earlier on.  Thus in a situation like \"\^a we would execute
% \handle@accentx and in case of \"a \handle@accent.  This command
% gets as its arguments the collected accents followed by the token
% which stopped the scanning proccess, e.g.
%
%   \handle@accentx \OT1\" \^ {a}
%
% and its purpose is to determine how to produce a glyph from it
% (e.g. as a composite or as a part composite or ...)
