%% This package was invented by Jeffrey P. Goldberg.
%% I thought that a replacement was needed and therefore created the
%% pageslts package,
%% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pageslts/pageslts.dtx
%% or
%% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/install/macros/latex/contrib/pageslts.tds.zip
%% . Nevertheless, for compatibility with existing documents/packages as well as
%% for the low amount of resources needed by the lastpage package (no new counter!),
%% I updated this package.
%% Thanks go to Jeffrey P. Goldberg for allowing me to do this.
%% 
%% This work consists of the main source file lastpage.dtx
%% and the derived files
%%    lastpage.sty, lastpage.pdf, lastpage.ins, lastpage.drv,
%%    lastpage-example.tex.
