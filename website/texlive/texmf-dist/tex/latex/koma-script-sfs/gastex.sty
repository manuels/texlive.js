%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% A lot of changes has been made since gastex 1.0 and as a result, 
% these new macros are no longer compatible with the previous ones.
% To be able to use old pictures, a compatible mode is provided
% (see \compatiblegastexun at the end of the file). The compatibility
% is almost 100% and should be sufficient in most cases.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% History since version 2.0
%
% 2.8:
% - packaged for CTAN
% 
% 2.7:
% - gastex is now compatible with the xcolor package which allows very
% useful color expressions such as red!50!blue!60!white.
% 
% 2.6:
% - improved precision of some computations
% 
% 2.5:
% The horizontal shifts that one gets sometimes (e.g. with overlays in 
% presentations) should no more occur provided \nullfont is used inside the 
% picture environment:
% \begin{picture}(100,35)(-50,0)\nullfont
% ...
% \end{picture}
% \selectfont is automatically used by gastex for node or edge labels.
% I found this solution looking in the package pgf (portable graphics 
% format) by Till Tantau. I also recommend his excellent beamer package 
% for laptop presentations.
% 
% 2.4:
% - added the macro \rpnode to allow nodes whose shape is a regular polygon
%   defined by its radius, its number of sides and an angle for the first point.
% - added the possibility to have arrows at the tail of edges and lines.
%   For this, the following new parameters are provided:
%   ATnb, ATdist, ATangle, ATlength, ATLength
% - added the macro \drawpolygon to draw a polygon defined by a list of points. 
% - added the macro \drawrpolygon to draw a regular polygon defined by 
%   its radius, its number of sides and an angle for the first point. 
% - added the macro \drawline to draw a broken line defined by n points. 
% - added the parameter "arcradius" in order to have arcs instead of sharp angles
%   for polygons and broken lines. The default is arcradius=0 for sharp angles.
% - added the macro \drawcurve to draw a continuous curve going through n points. 
% - added the macro \drawccurve to draw a continuous closed curve going through n points. 
% All these macros use gasset parameters and in particular: 
% Nframe, Nfill, linecolor, fillcolor, dash, ...
% 
% Uncompatibility: The macro \drawline was introduced in version 2.1 to 
% draw a line between two points. The new version allows to draw a line 
% defined by an arbitrary number of points but the syntax is different.
% It was \drawline(x1,y1,x2,y2) and it is now \drawline(x1,y1)(x2,y2).
% 
% 2.3:
% - added the parameter ELdistC (y or n) allowing to specify whether 
% the distance (ELdist) is between the center (y) of the label and the edge
% or between the side (n) of the label and the edge. 
% The behaviour of previous gastex versions corresponds to the setting
% (n) which is therefore the default.
% - added the macro \drawqbpedge allowing to specify the auxiliary 
% point of a quadratic Bezier curve with two angles instead of the 
% absolute coordinates required by \drawqbedge.
% - added parameters sxo, syo, exo, eyo (offsets in \unitlength).
% They define offsets for the virtual starting and ending points of an
% edge with respect to the centers of the starting and ending nodes.
% - improved drawing for arrowheads (in gastex.pro). 
% First, the direction of the arrowhead is better for curved edges.
% Second, when several arrowheads are drawn they follow the curve. 
% Previously, they followed the tangent at the ending point of the 
% edge which was bad for curved edges.
% 
% 2.2: 
% - added the options slide and paper to the package.
% In order to get the default settings for slides, use
%   \usepackage[slide]{gastex}
% The default settings for papers is obtained with
%   \usepackage[paper]{gastex}
% or
%   \usepackage{gastex}
% - added new option loopCW to define whether loops are in
% clockwise direction or not.
% - Fix a TeX error (Arithmetic overflow) that occurred when using
% \drawedge(A,B){} with two nodes A and B having the same coordinates.
% Now, in this case, an error message is issued in the log 
% and the macro \drawedge(A,B){} is ignored. 
% 
% 2.1: 
% - New macros to draw directly circles, rectanges, ovals,
% lines and bezier curves. 
%   \drawcircle, \drawrect, \drawoval, 
%   \drawline, \drawqbezier, \drawcbezier
% All these macros use gasset options and in particular: 
% Nframe, Nfill, linecolor, fillcolor, dash, AHnb, etc...
% - Compatibility mode for pspictpg up to v0.6
% - Fix the bug which occured sometimes when using Nw=0,Nh=0.
%  
% 2.01: 
% - Fix an error that occured in v2.0 when using Nfill=y without 
% defining previously fillgray or fillcolor.  
% The following default setting has been added.
% \gasset{fillgray=0,Nfill=n} % Not filled but black if filled
%

%
% Known problems and (hopefully) solutions.
% 
% 21/10/99: Frank Goertzen (frank.goertzen@unibw-muenchen.de) has 
% reported that when using gastex together with german an error may 
% occur when running dvips if the german package is loaded first.  The 
% solution is to load gastex before german:
% \usepackage{gastex} 
% \usepackage{german} 
% I have no idea concerning the cause of this error.
% 
% 07/03/00: A postscript error may occur when using Nw=0,Nh=0.
% Solution: Use a small value instead of 0, e.g. Nw=0.1,Nh=0.1
% Fixed in version 2.1.
% 
% 27/10/00: Using gasset inside a tabular or an array produces an error.
% The reason is that I'm using the "&" symbol as a marker in order to 
% process gasset options.
% Solution: Include the whole picture inside an mbox.
% \begin{tabular}{c}
%   \mbox{\begin{picture}(10,20)(-5,-5)
%   \gasset{ELdist=0}
%   \node(A)(0,0){1}\drawloop(A){$a$}
%   \end{picture}}
% \end{tabular}
% 
% pdflatex: gastex does not work with pdflatex since it produces 
% postscript code and pdflatex does not know what to do with it.
% Solution: Use latex and then ps2pdf.
% I don't know whether it is possible to translate my postscript code 
% into pdf code. The problem is that I'm using postscript to make some 
% computations and not only to draw the picture. 
% I would appreciate the help of a pdf guru on this.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Set values for gastex parameters.
% 
%   \gasset{parameter=value,parameter=value,...}
%   optional spaces are only allowed after commas
% 
% Nw=number
%   widht in \unitlength of oval nodes
% Nh=number
%   height in \unitlength of oval nodes
% Nmr=number
%   maximal radius in \unitlength of oval nodes
%   The actual radius will be min(Nw/2,Nh/2,Nmr)
%   Nmr=0 yields a rectangle node
%   
% Nadjust=any combination of the letters w,h,n
%   w : the node width is adjusted to the node label width + Nadjustdist
%   h : the node height is adjusted to the node label height + Nadjustdist
%   n : no adjustment
% Nadjustdist=number
%   distance in \unitlength between the label box and the node frame 
%   when using Nadjust
% 
% Nframe=y or n
%   boolean flag defining whether nodes are framed or not.
% Nfill=y or n
%   boolean flag defining whether nodes are filled or not.
%   Automatically set to true by the parameters fillgray and fillcolor
% 
% ExtNL=y or n
%   boolean flag defining whether node labels are external or not.
% NLangle=number
%   direction in degree of node labels
% NLdist=number
%   The meaning depends on the ExtNL flag.
%   If the flag is set to "n" then NLdist defines the distance
%   in \unitlength between the node center and the label center.
%   If the flag is set to "y" then NLdist defines the distance
%   in \unitlength between the node frame and the label box.
%   
% Nmarks=any combination of the letters i,f,r,n
%   i : initial mark on nodes
%   f : final mark on nodes
%   r : repeated mark on nodes
%   n : no mark on nodes
% ilength=number
%   length in \unitlength of arrows marking initial nodes
% iangle=number
%   direction in degree of arrows marking initial nodes
% flength=number
%   length in \unitlength of arrows marking final nodes
% fangle=number
%   direction in degree of arrows marking final nodes
% rdist=number
%   distance in \unitlength between the lines of repeated nodes
%   a positive value draw the second line inside the normal one
%   a negative value draw the second line outside the normal one 
%   but the edges are still connected to the normal line.
%   
%   An edge virtually starts from the center of the starting node and
%   ends at the center of the ending node (indeed they are only drawn 
%   outside of the nodes). It is possible to change the virtual starting 
%   and ending points of an edge using offsets with respect to the center
%   of the starting and ending node. This is the purpose of the following
%   parameters.
% sxo=number (starting x offset)
%   horizontal offset in \unitlength of the starting point of an edge 
%   with respect to the center of the starting node.
% syo=number (starting y offset)
%   vertical offset in \unitlength of the starting point of an edge 
%   with respect to the center of the starting node.
% exo=number (ending x offset)
%   horizontal offset in \unitlength of the ending point of an edge 
%   with respect to the center of the ending node.
% eyo=number (ending y offset)
%   vertical offset in \unitlength of the ending point of an edge 
%   with respect to the center of the ending node.
%   
% curvedepth=number
%   depth in \unitlength of curved edges between two nodes
%   The absolute value of curvedepth defines the distance between the
%   middle of the curved edge and the center of the line joining the two nodes 
%   With a positive/negative value the curved edge is on the left/right
%   of the line joining the two nodes.
%   
% loopdiam=number
%   diameters in \unitlength of loops
% loopangle=number
%   direction in degree of loops
% loopCW=y or n
%   boolean flag defining whether loops are in clockwise direction or not.
%
% AHnb=number
%   number of arrow(s) at the head of edges.
%   0 for no arrowhead.
% AHdist=number
%   distance in \unitlength between two arrowheads
% AHangle=angle
%   angle in degree between the edge and the arrowhead side
% AHLength=number
%   Length in \unitlegth of the arrowhead side
% AHlength=number
%   length in \unitlegth defining the shape of the arrowhead
%     0 for an arrowhead formed with just two lines
%     Length*cos(angle) for a triangular arrowhead
%     See examples.
%
% ATnb=number
%   number of arrow(s) at the tail of edges.
%   0 for no arrowhead.
% ATdist=number
%   distance in \unitlength between two arrowtails
% ATangle=angle
%   angle in degree between the edge and the arrowtail side
% ATLength=number
%   Length in \unitlegth of the arrowtail side
% ATlength=number
%   length in \unitlegth defining the shape of the arrowtail
%     0 for an arrowtail formed with just two lines
%     Length*cos(angle) for a triangular arrowtail
%     See examples.
% 
% ELside=l or r
%   label on the (l)eft or (r)ight side of the edge
% ELpos=0..100
%   position of the label along the edge.
%     0 : starting node
%    50 : middle of the edge
%   100 : ending node
% ELdist=number
%   distance in \unitlength between the label and the edge
% ELdistC=y or n
%   y : The distance is between the center of the label and the edge.
%       With ELdist=0 the center of the label is on the edge.
%   n : The distance is between the side of the label and the edge.
%       This is the default.
%       The distance is actually between the side of the label and
%       the tangent of the edge which is usually a good approximation. 
%       It may not work very well if the label is large and the edge is
%       strongly curved because then the tangent is far from the edge at the
%       point that achieve the distance between the tangent and the label.
%   
% linegray=decimal number between 0 and 1
%   gray level used to draw lines. 0=black, 1=white.
% fillgray=decimal number between 0 and 1
%   gray level used to fill nodes. 0=black, 1=white.
% linecolor=ColorName
%   color used to draw lines.
%   The color name should be defined in dvipsnam.def and one should 
%   include \usepackage[usenames]{color}.
%   This is to avoid the trouble of defining our own colors.
%   The drawback is that it is not possible to define and use other colors.
%   It should not be very restrictive since plenty of colours are 
%   defined in dvipsnam.def.
%   It should not be difficult to add the possibility of using new 
%   colors if needed. 
% fillcolor=ColorName
%   color used to fill nodes. See remarks above.
% linewidth=number
%   width in \unitlegth of lines
% dash={list of numbers}{offset}
%   Set the dash pattern used for drawing postscript paths.
%   The numbers in the list indicate alternatively lengths
%   in \unitlength of dashes and lengths in \unitlength of spaces. 
%   The list of lenghts is used circularly.
%   offset allows to start the pattern at some distance from its beginning.
%   Here are some examples:
%      dash={}{0} % continuous path
%      dash={1.5}0 % dashs of length 1.5 and empty spaces of length 1.5
%      dash={0.2 0.5}0 % looks like a sequence of dots
%      dash={4 1 1 1}0 % alternation of long and short dashs
%      dash={1.5}{1.5} % we start with the empty space and not the dash
%      dash={4}{2} % we start in the middle of the first dash
% 
% arcradius=number
%   radius in \unitlength of the arcs used at the vertices 
%   of polygons and broken lines. 0 for sharp angles.
% polyangle=angle
%   angle in degrees with respect to the x axis of the first vertex 
%   of the regular polygon.
