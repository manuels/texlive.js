% The standard LaTeX \bibliography definition invokes \sloppy, which in turn
% sets \tolerance to 10000.  This gives spacing that is too stretchable,
% with the result that wide white spaces appear in order to give right-
% justified output in two-column mode.  We redefine \thebibliography
% to invoke the original definition, then reset the tolerance to a more
% reasonable value.  We also allow a little \emergencystretch (a TeX 3.0
% feature) to allow individual lines to be slightly longer; if that
% name is unknown, the code avoids its use, so as to work with earlier
% versions of TeX.
