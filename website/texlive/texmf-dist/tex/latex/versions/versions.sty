%% SHORT DESCRIPTION: ================================================ 
% 
% Varies Stephen Bellantoni's `version.sty' in optionally omitting 
% environments, defining (among others) \includeversion and 
% \excludeversion as well as a `comment' environment. (For comparison 
% to `version.sty', see Section `IMPROVEMENTS' beneath \endinput.) So 
% multiple versions of a document may be printed from one source file. 
% Cf. packages `comment' (very similar functions and more, see 
% comparison after \endinput below), `verbatim', `optional' (on CTAN). 
% ---Needs LaTeX, even should work with LaTeX 2.09 
% (please tell me if not). 
% 
%% USAGE: ============================================================
% (User commands, Option, Customize, General warnings) 
% 
% *User commands*: ---------------------------------------------------
% 
% In the document part of your source file, put into environments 
%   \begin{VERSION}CODE\end{VERSION} 
% passages CODE (or other code) to be omitted optionally. VERSION may 
% be any string consisting of character tokens (see TeXbook, p. 40: 
% `\csname'), and the document may  contain environments with several 
% names of this kind (VERSIONa, VERSIONb, etc.). Preceding 
%   \excludeversion{VERSION}, \includeversion{VERSION}, 
%   \markversion{VERSION} 
% (in the preamble or even later on) control how these environments 
% behave. 
%   \excludeversion{VERSION}    `VERSION' environments just not 
%                               processed (ignored, i.e.); 
%   \includeversion{VERSION}    `VERSION' environments processed as 
%                               if \begin{VERSION} and \end{VERSION} 
%                               just were not present, however they 
%                               form groups like 
%                               \begin{relax}CODE\end{relax} 
%                               or \begingroup CODE \endgroup. 
%   \markversion{VERSION}       `VERSION' environments processed, 
%                               resulting text may be marked in 
%                               printout---for comparison of 
%                               variants of your document, e.g. 
% By default, these three commands send a message to screen, and 
% \markversion{VERSION} results in printed marks indicating start, 
% \end, and `VERSION'. Cf. subsection `Customize' below. 
% A warning is sent to screen if `VERSION' has been defined earlier 
% (by LaTeX, e.g.). (A `VERSION' environment must not overlap with 
% other environments, of course, must be balanced with respect to 
% \if...\fi, and must not contain \outer macros. In LaTeX the only 
% \outer macro is ^^L---ascii form feed.) 
%% TODO: 
% (`comment.sty' and comment environment from `verbatim.sty' 
%  are superior concerning \outer macros. On request, I could 
%  equip my \processifversion with that \outer feature.) 
% 
% However, \begin{VERSION}...\end{VERSION} breaks inside macro 
% arguments, e.g. of \footnote (it is even fragile). So there is 
%   \processifversion{VERSION}{CODE}
% working analogously (grouping as well), depending on \excludeversion 
% etc. (it is even robust). (`optional.sty' works similarly.)
% 
% A pre-installed instance of `VERSION' is `comment', which is 
% ignored by default. So you may put rather long comments as CODE 
% in \begin{comment}CODE\end{comment}. (This feature serves 
% compatibility with Stephen Bellantoni's `version.sty'.) 
% Note that alternative packages `comment' and `verbatim' define 
% \comment as well. 
% 
% *Options*: ----------------------------------------------------------
% 
%   \usepackage[tracing]{versions}
% causes (i) checking package commands for undefinedness, 
% (ii) messages on screen indicating line numbers of single excluded 
% environments (`Ignore VERSION, lines XX to YY]'). If final line 
% number and closing bracket don't appear on screen, the environment 
% presumably contains (implicit) \fi or \if... not matching each other 
% within that environment. This package option needs LaTeX2e and 
% TeX version greater equal 3.0. (No change of \processifversion.)
% 
%   \usepackage[nogroup]{versions}
% provides a user command \includeversionnogroup{VERSION} working like 
% \includeversion{VERSION}, but included `VERSION' will form no 
% grouping. 
% 
% *Customize*: -------------------------------------------------------
% 
% To change messages from \excludeversion, \includeversion, 
% \markversion, or to change printed marks resulting from 
% \markversion, take some of the following lines into your file, 
% remove left hand comment marks (`%'), and change the definition. 
% (Must perhaps be enclosed in \makeatletter...\makeatother 
%  or \catcode`\@=12 ...\catcode`\@=11.)
%   \renewcommand\versionmessage[2]{\typeout{*** `#1' #2. ***}} 
%   \renewcommand\beginmarkversion{\@Vs@sffbox{\@currenvir$>$}}
%   \renewcommand\endmarkversion{\@Vs@sffbox{$<$\@currenvir}}
% (For LaTeX2e, replace \renewcommand by \renewcommand*.) 
% 
% (1) \versionmessage is the style of screen reports from 
% \excludeversion etc. Any redefinition must use two arguments. 
% The first is the version name (VERSION), the second is one out of 
% `excluded', `included', `included with marks'. 
% 
% (2) \beginmarkversion and \endmarkversion is the style of marks 
% surrounding environments `VERSION' after \markversion{VERSION}. 
% Any redefinition must use no argument. \@currenvir is `VERSION'. 
% \@Vs@sffbox{CODE} as in package definition typesets argument CODE 
% as \textsf{CODE} and puts into an \fbox. 
% 
% *General warnings*: ------------------------------------------------
% (For legal warnings see top of file, 
%  for errors and requirements see `SHORT DESCRIPTION', 
%  option `tracing' and `user commands' above.) 
% This package uses \includeversion and \excludeversion and thus 
% cannot be used at the same time as Stephen Bellantoni's 
% `version.sty'.

COMPARISON with Viktor Eijkhout's `comment.sty': 
`Comment' even works under PlainTeX as well as LaTeX, present package 
under LaTeX only. \specialcomment in `comment' supports special 
surroundings---this is missing here (but could easily be supplied on 
request). %% TODO 
Included environments never form groups in `comment', here user may 
choose whether they form groups or not, at least for simple including 
(not with marks). `comment' includes by writing on and reading from 
disk, present package needs no writing on disk. 
Unlike the present package, `comment' skips even \outer macros, 
\if...'s and \fi's. (So `comment' is better for "real" comments. 
---Concerning \outer, this feature is important for PlainTeX, while 
under LaTeX the only \outer macro usually is ^^L.) 
`Comment' sometimes produces wrong spaces %% TODO still? 2003/10/03.
and discovers `\end{comment}' only if nothing else is in the input 
line. 

IMPROVEMENTS vis-a-vis Stephen Bellantoni's `version.sty': 
* \processifversion added for excluding text inside arguments of, 
  e.g., \footnote (where excluding *environment* would break). 
  \processifversion is even robust. 
* \@Esphack instead of \@esphack at \end of excluded environment; 
  needed for properly processing input space symbols there. 
* \begin and \end of included environment may appear in separate 
  lines without doubling spaces (\@bsphack and \@esphack used). 
* Screen messages sent by \includeversion and \excludeversion. 
* Large passages don't fill main memory when excluded. 
  (`s' in `versions' means `safe'!) 
* Optional tracing of excluded environments added. 
* Option of including without grouping. 
* Original \gdef and \csname #1END@NOTE\endcsname in 
  \excludeversion were superfluous. 

VERSION HISTORY: 
v0.1  2003/09/29  Very first; 
                  sent to Donald, Victor, Christian, Volker. 
v0.2  2003/09/30  \@sV@iffalse replacing \csname iffalse\fi; 
                  \@sV@ex: \@Esphack in group, extra \ignorespaces. 
v0.3  2003/10/01  Documentation: added warnings about \if...\fi and 
                  \outer---thanks to Victor Eijkhout; sent it to him. 
v0.31 2003/10/03  Documentation: added that `comment.sty' and 
                  `verbatim.sty' are superior in the respect 
                  discussed above; also added comparison with 
                  `comment.sty'. 
v0.4  2003/10/06  Documentation: Replaced stupid proposal of 
                  \aftergroup for including (needs stack!); 
                  retreated offer of partially enable skipping 
                  \outer/\if.../\fi. (\process... typically comes too 
                  late to change category codes.) 
                  \xdef -> \gdef for \@sV@ex. 
                  Then changed all `@sV' into `@Vs'. 
                  Documentation: Referred to TeXbook for character 
                  tokens in version names. 
                  Removed \@Vs@sphgobble from \@Vs@iprocess (leave 
                  spacing to user); now robust without \Declare... 
                  Then `phgobble' -> `phnoop'. 
                  Added option `nogroup'. 
                  Added \normalfont in \@Vs@sffbox. 
                  Sent to Victor E. 2005/10/05; minor changes in 
                  documentation afterwards. 
v0.5  2003/10/10  \@vS@iprocess -> \@vS@iprocess; 
                  \long\def\@Vs@iprocess. Sent to CTAN. 
v0.51 2003/10/15  Documentation: added `comment' drawback: 
                  \end{document} works in own line only. 
v0.52 2004/05/24  One `makro' -> `macro'. 
v0.53 2004/08/19  Named LPPL v1.3, added maintenance status. 
v0.54 2005/01/10  http://www.contact.uwe.lueck.de.vu, LPPL v1.3a. 
v0.55 2005/04/28  http://contact-ednotes.sty.de.vu; 
                  \global\@ignorefalse. 
%% TODO: delete at higher stages!?
