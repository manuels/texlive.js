%% === Category codes ===
%%
%% We use the ``underscore" as ``compound identifier." 
\catcode`\_=11 %% underscore used in control words
%%
%% |\MakeOther| is a synonym for `\@makeother', needed for matching 
%% special characters from the input file. It is exemplified by 
%% |\fdPatternCodes| which is the default of |\PatternCodes|. 
%% The latter is used in setup macros for reading patterns. 
%% We offer |\SetPatternCodes{<commands>}| 
%% (redefining `\PatternCodes')
%% and |\ResetPatternCodes| 
%% (for returning to `\fdPatternCodes') 
%% so setup scripts such as 'mdoccorr.cfg' have shorter lines.

%% It would be bad to have `\MakeOther\%' and `\MakeOther\ ' here in 
%% that this may have unexpected, weird effects with arguments of 
%% setup macros. (With `\MakeOther\ ' you must not indent within a
%% setup command, and if you add `\MakeOther\%' the setup command 
%% must stay in one line.)
%% Therefore neither `\dospecials' nor `\@sanitize' are 
%% used. Curly braces remain untouched as default delimiters in setup 
%% macros. For matching them, you must use `\MakeOther\{' and 
%% `\MakeOther\}'   %% corr. 2010/11/09

%% === A Combining Shorthand ===
%% \label{sec:final-input}
%% Before v0.5, the general idea was that some number of \strong{input} 
%% files would be combined for creating a single \strong{output} file 
%% (e.g., as opposed to \ctanpkgref{verbatimcopy}, regarding 
%% `\CopyFile').
%% According to experience, however, a \strong{single} input file 
%% typically suffices for generating an output file. 
%% Then |\CloseResultFile| (Sec.~\ref{sec:output}) 
%% may be called ``implicitly". The flag |\ifFinalInputFile|
%% will control (and generalize!) this 
%% (in `\ProcessFileWith', Sec.~\ref{sec:input}), 
%% and will be reset if changed 
%% (thinking of generating another file in the same \TeX\ run).
%% 
%% So 
%% |\ProcessFinalFileWith[<changes>]{<input>}{<loop-body>}| 
%% % |\ProcessFinalFileWith| works like `\ProcessFileWith'
%% works as with `\ProcessFileWith'
%% except that `\CloseResultFile' is issued after processing, 
%% so you can omit the latter.

%% === ``Substring Theory" === 
%% \begin{flushright}\it
%% I wished I could study string theory,\\
%% but I only could study substring theory.
%% \end{flushright}
%% A \TeX\ macro, say, `\find' whose parameter text 
%% (cf. \TeX book p.~203)
%% starts with `#1<pattern>#2&' stops \TeX\ with an error if it does 
%% not find <pattern> and then `&'. Otherwise we have a situation 
%% `\find<split1><pattern><split2>&', and `\find' reads <split1> as 
%% #1 and <split2> as #2. An important point to note is that <split1> 
%% will not contain <pattern>, but possibly <pattern> has more 
%% occurrences in <split2>. In this sense, `\find' uses the 
%% \emph{first} occurrence of <pattern> it finds in order to delimit #1. 
%% Finding the \emph{last} occurrence of <pattern> therefore needs a 
%% special idea. 
%%
%% In order to use `\find' for a test whether <pattern> is in 
%% <target>, we build a ``sandbox" |\find<sand>&|, where <sand> 
%% contains <target> \emph{and additionally} <pattern>---as a 
%% ``dummy;" so `&' delimits the search and `\find' finds 
%% <pattern> either in <target> or somewhere else before `&'. 
%%
%% Consider the simple sandbox |\find<target><pattern>&|. 
%% We can test #1 and #2 on being empty by `\ifx$#1$' and `\ifx$#2$'. 
%% If #2 is empty, <pattern> is \emph{not} in <target>. 
%% If #1 is empty at the same time, <target> is empty. 
%% If #1 is empty and #2 is not, <pattern> \emph{starts} 
%% <target>!\footnote{%% 2011/01/25:
%%                    This is just as wrong as the next claim.}
%% This can be used to implement 
%% Wikipedia-like lists                 %% TODO 2009/04/11
%% and to distinguish package code from comments in 
%% 'makedoc'.\footnote{%% 2011/01/25: 
%%                     Due to the special substrings to test in this 
%%                     application, this is true although the 
%%                     surrounding claims are wrong.}
%%
%% If #2 is \emph{not} empty, <pattern> occurs in <target>---or this once 
%% was \emph{thought}, some time in developping the present package, 
%% as well as in the version of 'substr.sty' marked 
%% `2005-11-29',\footnote{\url{http://ctan.org/pkg/substr}. 
%%                        'substr' does not change category codes 
%%                        as 'fifinddo' does 
%%                        and uses \cs{@nil} as delimiter instead of 
%%                        our &&.} try 
%% (if that version still is installed)\footnote{The ``feature" has 
%%                        been fixed with v1.2 as of 2009/10/20 of

%% \[`\IfSubStringInString{<str1><str2><str1>}{<str1><str2>}{YES}{NO}'\] 
%% which works \emph{verbatim} as well as considering <str1> and

%% \begin{center}

%%              I learn from Manuel P\'egouri\'e-Gonnard 
%%              that the first versions of his 'ted' 
%%              had a similar bug, fixed on v1.05 essentially like here; 
%%              Steven Segletes confirms that his 'stringstrings' doesn't

%% % \]
%% \end{center}
%%
%% In general, the previous approach \emph{fails if and exactly if} 
%% <pattern> has a \emph{period} $p$---less than its length---in the sense of that 
%% the $p$th token to the right or left of each token in <pattern> 
%% is the \emph{same} token. 
%% `AMSTERDAM' has a period 7,                  %% was 8 2011/01/20
%% `day after day' 10, `bonbon' 3, `bonobo' 4.
%% There is a counterexample <target> of length $p$ iff 
%% <pattern> has period $p$, namely the first substring of <pattern> 
%% having length $p$. If the length of <pattern> exceeds a multiple 
%% $mp$ of its period, the first $mp$ tokens of <pattern> form 
%% a counterexample <target>. 
%%
%% Therefore, a sandbox must have something between <target> and 
%% <pattern>.\footnote{Must? Actually, I preferred this solution to 
%%   other ideas like measuring the length of <split2>.}
%% We choose |\find<target>~<pattern>$&| as standard. 
%% The `$' will be used as an argument delimiter to get rid of the dummy 
%% <pattern> in <split2>, as well as to decide whether the match was 
%% in <target> or in the dummy part of the sandbox. 
%% The `$' can be replaced by another tilde `~' in order to 
%% test whether <target> \emph{ends} on a <pattern>, defining a macro 
%% like `\findatend' whose parameter text starts with `#1<pattern>~#2&'.
%% 
%% === Plan for proceeding ===
%% When we check a file for several patterns, we seem to need 
%% \emph{two} macros for each pattern: one that has the pattern 
%% in its parameter text and one that stores the pattern for building 
%% the sandbox.\footnote{If it were for the pattern only, the parsing 
%%   macro might suffice and the macro calling it might extract the 
%%   pattern from a ``dummy expansion." Somewhat too much for me now; 
%%   on the other hand the calling macro also hands some ``current" 
%%   informations to the parsing macro---oh, even this could be 
%%   handled by a general ``calling" macro \dots}
%%   %% TODO 2009/04/15
%% We use a separate \emph{``name space"} for each of 
%% both kinds. The parsing macro and the macro building the sandbox 
%% will have a common \emph{``identifier"} by which the user or 
%% programmer calls them. Actually, she will usually (first) call 
%% the sandbox box builder. The sandbox builder calls the parsing 
%% macro. When \emph{all} occurrences of a pattern in the target are 
%% looked for, the parser may call itself. 
%%
%% Actually, the parsing macro will execute certain actions 
%% depending on what it finds in the sandbox, so we call it a 
%% \emph{``substring conditional"}. It may read additional arguments 
%% after the sandbox that store information gathered before. 
%% This is especially useful for designing \emph{``expandable"} 
%% chains (sequences) of conditionals where macros cannot store information in 
%% macros. The macro setting up the sandbox will initialize such 
%% extra arguments at the same time. 
%%
%% It may be more efficient \emph{not} to use the following setup 
%% macros but to type the macros yourself, just using the following 
%% as templates. The setup macros are especially useful with patterns 
%% that contain ``special characters," as when you are looking for 
%% %% TODO repetition of single right quote not working 2010/03/19
%% lines that might be package comments. 
%%
%% === Meta-Setup ===
%%
%% A setup command <setup-cmd> will have the following syntax: 
%% \[|<setup-cmd>{<job-id>}[<changes>]{<pattern>}<more-args>|\]
%% <changes> will, in the first instance, be category code changes 
%% for reading <pattern> overriding the settings in `\PatternCodes'. 
%% They are executed after the latter in a local group. 
%% It may be safer to redefine `\PatternCodes' instead 
%% of using the optional <changes> argument.
%%
%% A macro 
%% \[|\StartFDsetup{<do-setup>}{<job-id>}[<changes>]|\]
%% shared by setup commands 
%% may read <job-id> and <changes> for <setup-cmd>. 
%% |<do-setup>| will be the macro that reads <pattern> (and more) 
%% and processes it. It must contain `\endgroup' to match 
%% `\begingroup' from `\FD_prepare_pattern'.
%% <job-id> is stored in a macro |\fdParserId|.
%% The default for <changes> is \emph{nothing}.
\newcommand*{\StartFDsetup}[1]{%
    \let\FD_do_setup#1%
    \afterassignment\FD_prepare_pattern
    \def\fdParserId}
\newcommand*{\FD_prepare_pattern}[1][]{%
    \begingroup \PatternCodes #1\FD_do_setup}
%% So <setup-cmd> should be set up about as follows:
%% \begin{quote}
%%   `\newcommand*{<setup-cmd>}{\StartFDsetup<do-setup>}'\\
%%   `\newcommand*{<do-setup>}[<args>]{<action>}'
%% \end{quote}
%% <do-setup>'s first argument will be the <pattern> argument
%% of <setup-cmd>.---With v0.5, we learn from the previous and provide 
%% \[|\MakeSetupCommand{<setup-cmd>}{<do-setup>}[<args>]{<action>}|\]

                                   \newcommand*#2}

%% === Setup for conditionals ===
%% `substr_cond' is the ``name space" for substring conditionals. 
%% A colon separates it from \emph{``job identifiers"} in the actual 
%% macro names. 
\def\substr_cond{substr_cond:}
%%
%% |\MakeSubstringConditional{<id>}[<changes>]{<pattern>}|

%%                here somehow refers to this macro---but rather to 
%%                its ``parameter text" only, 
%%                according to \TeX book p.~203. Such a macro, 
%%                however, won't ``parse" only, but it will also 
%%                execute some job on the results of parsing. 
%%                Or: a ``mere parsing" macro might be macro that 
%%                transforms a ``weird" Plain \TeX\ parameter text
%%                into a ``simple" parameter text of another macro, 
%%                consisting of hash marks and digits only. E.g.: 
%%                &\def&\Foo#1<pattern>#2&&{&\foo{#1}{#2}}.}
%% The user or programmer macro produces the part of the definition 
%% until the delimiter `&' to match the sandbox. You have to add 
%% (maybe) #3 etc. and the `{<definition text>}' 
%% just as with primitive \TeX.
%%
%% === Setup for sandboxes === 
%% There was a \emph{question:} will we rather see 
%% \emph{string macros} or \emph{strings from macro arguments}? 
%% The input file content always comes 
%% as `\fdInputLine' first, so we at least \emph{must account} for 
%% the possibility of string macros as input.
%%
%% One easy way to apply several checks and substitutions to 
%% `\fdInputLine' before the result is written to <output> is 
%% `\let\OutputString\fdInputLine' and then let `\OutputString' 
%% be to what each job refers as \emph{its} 
%% input and output, finally `\WriteResult{\OutputString}'. 
%% (`\fdInputLine' might better not be touched, it could be used 
%% for a final test whether any change applied for some message on 
%% screen, even with an entirely expandable chain of actions.)
%% This way each job, indeed each recursive substitution of a single 
%% string must start with expanding `\OutputString'. 
%%
%% On the other hand, there is the idea of \emph{``expandable" 
%% chains of substitutions}. We may, e.g., define a macro, say, 
%% `\manysubstitutions{<macro-name>}', such that 
%% `\WriteResult{\manysubstitutions{\fdInputLine}}'
%% writes to <output> the result of applying many expandable 
%% substitutions to `\fdInputLine'. 
%% Such a macro `\manysubstitutions' may read `\fdInputLine', 
%% but it must not redefine any macros. 
%% Instead, the substitution macros it calls must read results 
%% of previous substitutions as \emph{arguments}.
%% 
%% Another aspect: 
%% the order of substitutions should be easy to 
%% change. Therefore expanding of string macros should rather be 
%% controlled by the way a job is \emph{called}, not right here 
%% at the \emph{definition} of the job. For this reason, 
%% a variant of the sandbox builder expanding some macro was given up.

%% This feature could have been placed more below as a ``programming

%%
%% 
%%  == Programming tools ==
%% === Tails of conditionals ===
%% \label{sec:tails}
%% When creating complex \emph{expandable} conditionals, 
%% this may amount to have primitive `\if' ... `\fi' conditionals 
%% nested quite deeply, once perhaps too deep for \TeX's memory. 
%% To avoid this, you can apply the common `\expandafter' trick 
%% which finishes the current `\if' ... `\fi' before an inside 
%% macro is executed (cf. \TeX book p.~219 on ``tail recursion").
%%
%% Internally tests whether certain strings are present at certain 
%% places will be carried out by tests on emptiness or 
%% %% onwards) %% !? 2009/12/28
%% on starting with `~'. E.g., 
%% ``#1~=~<split1> empty" indicates that either the <pattern> 
%% starts a line or the line is empty altogether (this must be 
%% decided by another test). 
%%
%% |\IfFDempty{<arg>}{<when-empty>}{<when-not-empty>}| \ 
%% is used to test <arg> on emptyness (without expanding it): 
\newcommand*{\IfFDempty}[1]{%
  \ifx$#1$\expandafter \@firstoftwo  \else
          \expandafter \@secondoftwo \fi}
%% |\IfFDinputEmpty{<when-empty>}{<when-not-empty>}| is a variant of 
%% the previous to execute <when-empty> if the loop processing <input> 
%% finds an empty line---otherwise <when-not-empty>.
\newcommand*{\IfFDinputEmpty}{%
  \ifx\fdInputLine\@empty \expandafter \@firstoftwo  \else
                          \expandafter \@secondoftwo \fi}
%% |\IfFDdollar{<arg>}{<when-dollar>}{<when-not-dollar>}| 
%% %% <- dollar<-empty
%% is another variant, testing <split2> for being `$', 
%% main indicator of there is a match anywhere in <target> 
%% (as opposed to starting or ending match):
\newcommand*{\IfFDdollar}[1]{%
  \ifx$#1\expandafter \@firstoftwo  \else
         \expandafter \@secondoftwo \fi}
%% It is exemplified and explained in section~\ref{sec:replchain}.
%% (The whole policy requires that `~' remains active in any 
%%  testing macros here!)
%%
%% However, you might always just type the replacement text 
%% (in one line) instead of 
%% such an `\If'\,... (for efficiency \dots)
%%
%% If expandability is not desired, you can just chain macros that 
%% rework (so re-define) `\OutputString' or so. 
%%
%% 2009/04/11: tending towards combining ...
%% Keeping empty input and empty arguments apart is useful in that 
%% \emph{one} test of emptiness per input line should suffice---it
%% may be left open whether this should be the first of all tests 
%% \dots
%% 
%% |\IfFDpreviousInputEmpty{<when-empty>}{<when-not-empty>}|
%% (v0.42)
%% is a companion of `\IfFDpreviousInputEmpty' referring to 
%% `\fdInputLine' as of the \emph{previous} run of the loop 
%% in `\ProcessFileWith', cf. section~\ref{sec:input}, 
%% where its choice among its two arguments is determined. 
%% It is initialized as follows:
\newcommand*{\IfFDpreviousInputEmpty}[2]{#2}
%% ---which is same as
\let\IfFDpreviousInputEmpty\@secondoftwo
%% ... working like `false', somewhat. 
%% Together with `\IfFDinputEmpty', it can be used to compress
%% multiple adjacent empty lines into a single one 
%% when copying a file.
%%
%% === Line counter ===
%% A \LaTeX\ counter |fdInputLine| may be useful for screen or log 
%% messages, moreover you can use it to control processing of the 
%% <input> file ``from outside," not dependent on what the parsing 
%% macros find. The header of the file might be typeset verbatim, 
%% but we may be too lazy to define the ``header" in terms of 
%% what is in the file. We just decide that the first ... lines 
%% are the ``header," even without counting just trying whether 
%% the output is fine. It may be necessary to change that number 
%% manually when the header changes. 
%% 
%% You also can insert lines in <output> 
%% which have no counterpart in <input>---if you know what you are 
%% doing. With 'makedoc', there is a hook `\EveryComment' that can 
%% be used to issue commands ``from outside" at a place where 
%% executing the command is safe or appropriate. 
\newcounter{fdInputLine}
%% You then must insert \ |\CountInputLines| \ in the second argument 
%% of `\ProcessFileWith' (or in a macro called from there) 
%% so that the counter is stepped. %% TODO!? 2009/04/07
\newcommand*{\CountInputLines}{\global\advance\c@fdInputLine\@ne}
%% At present %% 2009/04/07 TODO 
%% the counter is reset by `\ProcessFileWith', this may change. 
%%
%% |\IfInputLine{<relation><number>}{<true>}{<false>}|, when called 
%% from the processing loop (second argument of `\ProcessFileWith')
%% issues <true> commands if `\value{fdInputLine}<relation><number>' 
%% is true, otherwise <false>. <relation> is one out of 
%% \HardNVerb+<+, `=', `>'. %% 2010/03/24 2010/03/29

%% === ``Identity job" `LEAVE' and ``default job" `*' ===
%% \label{sec:LEAVE}\label{sec:*}
%% The job with identifier |LEAVE| 
%% \emph{leaves} an (expandable) chain of jobs 
%% (as expandable replacement in section~\ref{sec:replchain}) 
%% and \emph{leaves} the processed string without changing it 
%% and without the braces enclosing it:
\expandafter \let 
  \csname \setup_substr_cond LEAVE\endcsname \@firstofone
%% I.e., `\ProcessStringWith{<string>}{LEAVE}' expands to <string> 
%% ... \ProcessStringWith{(Indeed!)}{LEAVE}
%% 
%% |LEAVE| is used for ``chaining" jobs---there will be a routine 
%% (Sec.~\ref{sec:auto-chain}) 
%% to define the action of a job, including what job to run 
%% \emph{next} after the present one has been finished.
%% Using this routine, the final job will call `LEAVE'.
%%
%% |*| may be considered a ``meta-job"---it does not directly 
%% set up a sandbox, it just ``redirects" to the job that has been 
%% declared most recently. When job ids are assigned automatically, 
%% with `*' you can call that job without knowing its actual id:
\@namedef{\setup_substr_cond*}{%
    \csname \setup_substr_cond \fdParserId \endcsname}
%% As an important example, when all the jobs in the chain are 
%% expandable, you can call the chain by 
%% \[|\WriteResult{\ProcessInputWith{*}}|\]
%% in the body of the file processing loop (Sec.~\ref{sec:input}).

%%  == Setup for expandable chains of replacements ==
%% \label{sec:replchain}%% TODO makedoc: provide less visible label/ref 2009/04/11 
%% By the following means, you can create macros 
%% (`\Transform' among them) such that, e.g., 
%% \[`\edef\OutputString{\Transform{<string>}}'\] renders `\OutputString' 
%% the result of applying a chain (sequence) of stringwise replacements 
%% to <string>. 
%% You can even write a transformed input <string> to a file 
%% without defining anything after `\read to'\,.\,.\,. %% corr. 2010/11/24
%% In this case however, you don't get any statistical message 
%% about what happened or not. With `\edef\OutputString' you can at 
%% least issue some `changed!' or `left!' (maybe `\message{!}' vs.\ 
%% `\message{.}'). 
%% There is an application in 'makedoc' for ``typographical upgrading" 
%% from plain text to \TeX\ input. 
%%
%% === The backbone macro ===
%% |\repl_all_chain_expandable| will be the backbone of the 
%% replacements. It is called by some parsing macro <parser>
%% and receives from the latter <split1>~=~#1 and <split2>~=~#2. 
%% #3 is the result of what happened so far.

%%                 %%      or refer to here. 
%% And this is the case \emph{exactly} when the <pattern> from 
%% <parser> didn't match, again due to the input category codes. 
%% Now on \emph{no} match, the sandbox builder #6 is called 
%% with target string #3#1 where the last tested string is attached
%% to previous results. The ending `~' is removed, #6 inserts a new 
%% wrap for the new dummy pattern.
