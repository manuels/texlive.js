% Corrections, suggestions and contributions by:
%%%%%%
% 
% Some of the following contributions came years ago, others quite
% recently:
%
% Spanish: Juanjo <jj.hfmc@gmail.com> and Lee Rudolph <lrudolph@panix.com>
%
% Corrections of Italian orthography: Paolo Cusinu <paolo.cusinu@gmail.com>
% 
% Estonian and a patch for using fp: Priit Laes <plaes@plaes.org>
%
% Another patch for fp: AFresh1, March 2011 % e-mail: andrew@afresh1.com
%
% One variant of Spanish: Matias Banchoff <matiasb@cespi.unlp.edu.ar>
%
%%%%%%
% Jacopo, May 2003
% e-mail: jacopo@
%
%   Contributed labels in Italian.
%
%%%%%%
% O. Corff, July 2003 
% 
%   fixed one nasty spacing bug, simplified internal table 
%   construction (table now has five instead of six columns,
%   the second of which was never used).
%
%%%%%%
% Johann Spies, January 21, 2002
% e-mail: jspies@sun.ac.za
%
%   Hinted that \Subtotal Project should show the project name
%   rather than just `Project'.
%
%   Contributed labels in Afrikaans.
%
%%%%%%
% Robin Fairbairns, December 6, 2001
% 
%   Hinted that the dollar sign can also be printed by saying
%   \string$.
%
%%%%%%
% Vincent Tougait, France, November 27, 2001
%
%   Pointed out that fractions of VAT percents were not allowed.
%   Bugfix on December 06, 2001
%
%%%%%%
% Fred Donck, The Hague, The Netherlands, October, 2001
% e-mail: fd0@donck.com
%
% Dutch labels
%
%%%%%%
% Ian Wormsbecker, October 31, 2001
%
%   Skips the VAT lines if VAT=0
%   Noticed that the terminal message will not accept a Dollar sign.
%   The only workaround is to say \char`$ in \begin{invoice}{}
%
%%%%%%
% Fred Donck, The Hague, The Netherlands, Sept 18, 2001
% e-mail: fd0@donck.com
%
% fixed some minor issues:
%   real arithmetic will use integer intermediate values, so
%   some calculations failed with the \Fee{title}{rate}{amount}
%   where \rate is not an integer
%
%   another fix is that in my opinion the VAT line should be 
%   printed also even though only one project is specified
%
%   third fix is that the subtotal-line should not be printed 
%   on a project with only one \Fee line
%
%%%%%%
% Jacco Kok (fixed some labels),
%
%%%%%%
% Thilo Barth (discussed alternative names and command clashes
%	with KOMA Script class scrlettr.cls),
%
%%%%%%
% Robert Inder (discussed general issues)
%
% were gladly and gratefully received and accepted.
