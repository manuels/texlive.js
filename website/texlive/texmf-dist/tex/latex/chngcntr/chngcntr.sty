%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% USAGE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%     In LaTeX, a new counter called, say `ctr', is created by the command
% \newcounter{ctr}[within]. If the optional within argument is given
% the the counter `ctr' is reset to zero each time the counter `within'
% changes. The command \thectr typesets the value of the counter ctr.
% This is automatically defined by \newcounter and is initialised
% to typeset arabic numerals.	
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \counterwithin
% \counterwithin*
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%    It is sometimes desireable to change a counter that has been defined
% by \newcounter{ctr} to act as though it had been defined as 
% \newcounter{ctr}[within]. The package provides the command
% \counterwithin{ctr}{within} that accomplishes this. By default,
% it also redefines the \thectr command so that it typesets values
% in the style \thewithin.\arabic{ctr}. The starred version of the
% command suppresses the redefinition of \thectr 
% (e.g., \counterwithin*{ctr}{within}).
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \counterwithout
% \counterwithout*
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%    Likewise, the command \counterwithout{ctr}{within} changes a
% counter that has been created by \newcounter{ctr}[within] to act
% as though it had been created by \newcounter{ctr}. By default it
% also redefines the \thectr command so that it just typesets an arabic
% numeral. The starred version of the command suppresses the redefinition
% of \thectr.
%
%    Any number of \counterwithin{ctr}{...} and \counterwithout{ctr}{...}
% commands can be issued for a given counter, ctr, if you wish to toggle
% between the two styles. The current value of ctr is unaffected by
% \counterwithin and \counterwithout. If you want to change the value
% after one of these commands, use \setcounter{ctr}{...}, and to change
% the typeseting style use \renewcommand{\thectr}{...}.
