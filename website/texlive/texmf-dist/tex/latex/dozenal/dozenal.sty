% The |dozenal| package provides some simple mechanisms for
% working with the dozenal (duodecimal or ``base 12'')
% numerical system.  It redefines all basic \LaTeX\
% counters, provides a command for converting arbitrary
% decimal numbers into dozenal, and provides new, real
% Metafont characters for ten and eleven, though the
% commands for producing them can be redefined to produce
% any figure.  As of v2.0, it also includes Type 1 versions
% of the fonts, used automatically whenever T1 encoding is
% selected for the document.  This package uses the |\basexii| 
% algorithm by David Kastrup.

% \section{Introduction}
% \label{sect:intro}
% 
% While most would probably call it at best overoptimistic and
% at worst foolish, some people (the author included) do still
% find themselves attracted to the dozenal (base-twelve)
% system.  These people, however, have been pretty hard
% up\footnote{This is an Americanism for ``out of luck'' or
% ``in difficult circumstances,'' for those who do not
% know.} in the \LaTeX\ world.  There is no package file
% available which produces dozenal counters, like page and
% chapter numbers, nor were there \emph{any} (I made a
% pretty diligent search) dozenal characters for ten and
% eleven, leaving dozenalists forced to use such makeshift
% ugliness as the ``X/E'' or ``T/E'' or ``*/\#'' or whatever
% other standard they decided to use.  While this sort of
% thing may be acceptable in ASCII, it's absolutely
% unacceptable in a beautiful, typeset document.
% 
% Enter the |dozenal| package.  This package automates all
% the messiness of being a dozenalist and using \LaTeX.  It
% redefines all the counters (though you'll have to redefine
% them yourself if you're using your own), provides an
% algorithm (generously donated by the intrepid David
% Kastrup) for converting arbitrary positive whole numbers
% into dozenal (this is e\TeX, but all modern distributions
% will compile that), and finally, it includes original
% dozenal characters, specifically designed to blend in well
% with Knuth's Computer Modern fonts, though they should do
% fine with the more common body fonts, as well.
% 
% This document was typeset in accordance with the \LaTeX\
% \textsc{docstrip} utility.
%
% \section{Usage}
% \label{sect:usage}
%
% The |dozenal| package provides four new commands (though
% I can only take credit for two of them).  The first, and
% by far the most important given the purpose and content of
% this package, is |\basexii|\DescribeMacro{\basexii}.  This
% is a very simple command which takes the following
% structure:
% \begin{quote}
% \cs{basexii}\marg{number}\marg{ten symbol}\marg{eleven symbol}
% \end{quote}
% What the above means is that the command is |\basexii| and
% it takes three mandatory arguments:  first, the number to
% be converted into dozenal; second, the symbol that should
% be used for ten; and third, the symbol that should be used
% for eleven.  This number should be positive and whole;
% that is, it should be zero or higher, and it should not
% contain a fractional part.  \TeX\ is a typesetting
% program, after all; if you want a robust decimal to
% dozenal converter, there are many options that any
% dozenalists caring enough to use this package will already
% know about.
% 
% This |\basexii| algorithm was produced by David Kastrup,
% well known and admired in the \TeX\ world for his many
% useful packages and other contributions.  He posted this
% algorithm on comp.text.tex; it is included here with his 
% kind and generous permission.
%
% That one would want to use the same ten and eleven symbols
% throughout a document seems a reasonable assumption;
% therefore, I have provided a simplified version of the
% |\basexii| command, |\dozens|\DescribeMacro{\dozens}.
% |\dozens| takes only a single argument, the number to be
% converted; the ten and eleven symbols used are those
% produced by the commands |\x| and |\e|, to which we'll get
% in a moment.
% 
% |\x|\DescribeMacro{\x}\ and |\e|\DescribeMacro{\e}\ are the
% commands used to quickly and easily access the symbols for
% ten and eleven without having to use active characters
% (the \TeX\ gurus will know what that means; if you don't
% know, that's okay; you don't need to to use this package
% effectively).  In any case, |\x| and |\e| default to using
% the special dozenal characters that are part of this
% package; they could be easily redefined if for some reason
% you don't like the Pitman characters (which this package,
% and the Dozenal Society of Great Britain, prefer), in the
% following manner:
% \begin{quote}
% |\renewcommand\x{X}|
% \end{quote}
% Or whichever characters you like to use.  If you prefer
% the Dozenal Society of America's proposed characters (a
% stylized X and E), then this package will disappoint you.
% May I suggest |$\chi$| ($\chi$) and |$\xi$| ($\xi$) as a
% stopgap while you locate or produce real characters of
% your own?  Sorry; I'm an American myself, but I much
% prefer the Pitman characters for a variety of reasons
% (feel free to email me if you care), and creating fonts in
% \MF, even small and inconsequential ones like this, is too
% much work for characters that I don't even like.
% 
% The |dozenal| package also redefines all the standard
% \LaTeX\ counters, such as |section| and |enumii|.  If
% you've defined your own counters, you'll need to define
% them yourself; however, this is an easy matter: 
% \begin{quote}
% |\renewcommand\thecounter{\basexii{\arabic{counter}}{\x}{\e}}|
% \end{quote}
% For example.  Of course, you can fill in the |\x| and |\e|
% with whatever you want (though it would make more sense to
% simply redefine |\x| and |\e|, so that all the counters
% would use the same characters), or you could use the
% |\dozens| command instead.  Whatever your pleasure might
% be.
% 
% \section{Implementation}
% \label{sect:code}
% 
% First, we name the package that we provide.  This is
% not exactly the most difficult part of the code.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\ProvidesPackage{dozenal}[2012/05/13 v3.2 support for dozenal fonts]
%    \end{macrocode}
% Now we need to make sure that we have fixltx2e loaded, so
% that the |\TextorMath| magic will work.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{fixltx2e}
%    \end{macrocode}
% Now we ensure that |ifpdf| is loaded, so that we can test
% for pdf or dvi modes.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{ifpdf}
%    \end{macrocode}
% We then define the font that we're using for our
% \MF-produced Pitman characters.  Incidentally, we also
% define the command |\doz|, though I can't foresee any
% decent use for it except in packages and preambles; it is
% then used to define |\x| and |\e|, which provide the ten
% and eleven symbols for all the counter redefinitions.
% This includes definitions for both T1 and OT1 encodings,
% so it will work with either.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareFontFamily{OT1}{dozch}{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{dozch}{m}{n}{<-7> dozchars6 <7> dozchars7 <8> dozchars8 <9> dozchars9 <10-11> dozchars10 <12-16> dozchars12 <17-> dozchars17  }{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{dozch}{b}{n}{<-> dozchb10 }{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{dozch}{bx}{n}{<-6> dozchbx6 <7> dozchbx7 <8> dozchbx8 <9> dozchbx9 <10-11> dozchbx10 <12-> dozchbx12 }{}

\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{dozch}{m}{it}{<-7> dozchit7 <8> dozchit8 <9> dozchit9 <10-11> dozchit10 <12-> dozchit12 }{}
\DeclareFontShape{OT1}{dozch}{bx}{it}{<-> dozchbxi10 }{}
\ifpdf
	\pdfmapfile{=fdz.map}
\fi
\DeclareFontFamily{T1}{dozch}{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{dozch}{m}{n}{<-> fdzr8r  }{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{dozch}{bx}{n}{<-> fdzb8r }{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{dozch}{m}{sl}{<-> fdzs8r }{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{dozch}{bx}{sl}{<-> fdzbo8r }{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{dozch}{m}{it}{<-> fdzso8r }{}
\DeclareFontShape{T1}{dozch}{bx}{it}{<-> fdzbi8r }{}
\newcommand\doz[1]{{\fontfamily{dozch}\selectfont #1}}
\newcommand\x{\TextOrMath{\protect\doz{{X}}}{\X}}%
\newcommand\e{\TextOrMath{\protect\doz{{E}}}{\E}}%
\DeclareSymbolFont{dozens}{OT1}{dozch}{m}{n}
\DeclareMathSymbol{\X}{\mathord}{dozens}{88}
\DeclareMathSymbol{\E}{\mathord}{dozens}{69}
%    \end{macrocode}
% Then we define our command which will produce the dozenal
% numbers from decimal sources.  This algorithm was taken
% directly from the publicly available archives of
% comp.text.tex, where it was posted by the well-known and
% redoubtable David Kastrup.  We also define the |\dozens|
% command, a simplified |\basexii| (which, in fact, depends
% utterly upon |\basexii|), just to make it easy for
% everyone.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\basexii#1#2#3{\ifcase\numexpr(#1)\relax
0\or1\or2\or3\or4\or5\or6\or7\or8\or9\or#2\or#3\else
\expandafter\basexii\expandafter{\number\numexpr((#1)-6)/12}{#2}{#3}\expandafter\basexii\expandafter{\number\numexpr(#1)-((#1)-6)/12*12}{#2}{#3}\fi}
\newcommand\dozens[1]{\basexii{#1}{\x}{\e}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% Now, of course, we simply redefine all the counters.  This
% covers only those counters included in the basic \LaTeX\
% document classes, however, so if you've written your own,
% you'll need to redefine them yourself.
%
% This first bit ensures that the counters are redefined
% even if the command |\mainmatter| is not defined.  We have
% to do this outside of the |\g@addto@macro| below;
% otherwise, in documents where |\mainmatter| is defined but
% not used, the counters will not be redefined.  This way,
% they're redefined in all cases.
