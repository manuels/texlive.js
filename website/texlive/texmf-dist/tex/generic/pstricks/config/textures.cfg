%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% !! GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS !! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Because there are no standards for dvi-to-PS driver \special's,
some driver-dependent commands must be defined in this file.

Possibly correct definitions for some dvi drivers are given below.
Copy the section for the driver you want to use to the indicated place
near the beginning of the file, replacing any other definitions you
might find there.

When changing drivers, you may need to remake the header file.

See the PSTricks read-me file for further installation instructions.

Please report good and bad experiences with dvi-to-PS drivers,
along with the definitions of these commands that worked
for you, to tvz@Princeton.EDU.  Thanks.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% DESCRIPTION OF CONFIGURATION DEFINITIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Here are the commands that must be defined in this file:

   \pstverb{}    -  The argument is included as verbatim PostScript,
                    grouped by save and restore. The coordinate system
	should be square, not rotated, and with the origin
	at TeX's currentpoint.

   \pstVerb{}    -  The argument is included as verbatim PostScript, not
                    grouped by (g)save and (g)restore. The currentpoint
	should be TeX's currentpoint.

   \pstunit      -  The units used by driver for graphics included with
                    \pstverb. Probably 1bp or 1sp.

   \pstverbscale - The PostScript code that scales the coordinate system
                   from that in effect with \pstVerb to that in effect
                   with \pstverb. Should not translate to the currentpoint.

   \pstrotate    - The PostScript code that takes a number off the stack
                   and rotates the axes properly. I.e.,
                   \pstVerb{angle \pstrotate} is used to begin rotations.

   \pstheader{}  - The argument is a header file (e.g., .pro file).
                   If your driver does not support such a special, then
                   the command might just remind you to include the header
                   when printing. You can use PSTricks without a header,
                   in which case it does not matter how you define
                   \pstheader. See read-me.pst for details.
                   If you cannot change the default directory where your
                   driver looks for header files, and you cannot write to
                   that directory, then you include the path for your
                   PSTricks header files.
                   E.g., \def\pstheader#1{\special{header=~/tex/#1}}.

   \pstdriver    - The name of the driver.


%%%%%%%%% !! HOW TO MAKE A TEX FORMAT WITH PSTRICKS PRELOADED !! %%%%%%%%

See your local TeX documentation for instructions on creating a TeX format.

Before making the format, be sure that this configuration file is correct.
It will be read only when creating the format, and not with every job.

If you are not using header files, there are no more special instructions.

Special instructions when using header files:

 - If you want to include supplementary PSTricks files (e.g., pst-node.tex),
   add \input commands in the customization section above.

 - If your definition of \pstheader is, e.g.

     \def\pstheader#1{\special{\header=#1}}

   then change it to

     \def\pstheader#1{%
       \expandafter\everyjob\expandafter{\the\everyjob
         \special{header=#1}}}

   and put your original definition in the customization section, AFTER
   any \input commands. E.g., the customization section might look like:

     \pstcustomize
     \input pst-node.tex
     \input pst-coil.tex
     \def\pstheader#1{\special{header=#1}}

 - Input pstricks.tex at the appropriate time when creating the format.
   E.g., when initex stops running:
     *\input pstricks
     *\dump

%% END: pstricks.con
